## Static site build with components - attempt 1

Work in progress

I'm familiar with Middleman and Ruby so attempting to build components using trailblazer cells. Feels quite verbose and also quite messy with the mix of Padrino helpers and ActionView. Also not really how I think the componets should be built with everything separated out across the codebase rather than a nice tight unit of HTML, JS and CSS. Next step, ditch this and start to look at a JS implementation but without shipping a ton of JS just to get basic sites running.
